Recently I've been working on modifying one of the addons in Firefox. It isn't complete as I am working on learning some more about Java script in general before I modify anything more but when it is finished, I'm hoping to make the addon have the ability to let the user choose which color they want to change the border of their tab to. This is of course a modification to the original group assighnment we ahd for week two. (We had worked on implementing an addon that allowed for you to be able to click on a tab on the firefox toolbar and change the color of your backround to a purple. I wanted to make it be able to give options for what colors you could choose)
