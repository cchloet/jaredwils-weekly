title: Week 2
---


The second week was definitely a tough one for me personally. Working in a group was hard. I noticed that the times that I was free to work on the assignment didn't always align with the time that my group members were free. It left me confused as to what I should be working on and when. This was no fault of my group members but more of an acclimation period for myself. However, I do feel as though the assignment has given me some idea of how to add and contribute to an online repository. I definitley had some misconceptions when it came to the different files within an open source repository. One noticeable mixup was the difference between the code of conduct and the contributing files. From my first glance I thought that the contributing file had to do with the contributions that have been made, when they've been made and who was contributing but in reality it is far from that. It is more instructional than I first expected. I had also thought that the code of conduct was closer to what the contributing file actually was. This was also off as the code of conduct file focuses on behavior rather than the way in which you should contribute. Interpersonal conflict is not something I notice whenever I think about working with people through a repository, but it is a truly integral part of keeping a productive, online work environment.
